## üìä Key Analysis Performed

### Monthly Sales Analysis
- Calculate total sales for each month.
- Identify the month with the highest and lowest sales.
### Category-wise Sales Analysis
- Group sales data by product category.
- Determine the highest-selling and lowest-selling categories.
### Sub-category Sales Analysis
- Analyze sales at the sub-category level.
- Visualize top and bottom performing sub-categories.
### Monthly Profit Analysis
- Calculate monthly profit from sales data.
- Find out which month recorded the maximum profit.
### Profit by Category & Sub-category
- Compare profit margins across categories and sub-categories.
- Highlight most and least profitable segments.
### Sales & Profit by Customer Segment
- Analyze data by customer segments (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
- Compare which segment brings in more sales and profit.
### Sales-to-Profit Ratio Analysis
- Calculate sales-to-profit ratio for better understanding of efficiency.
- Identify categories or segments where high sales do not result in proportional profit.
